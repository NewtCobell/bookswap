# To generate a secret key you can use locally, run the following commands in your Python console:

# >>> import random
# >>> ''.join(random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)') for i in range(50))
# save this new key below, in between the quotes
# change the name of this file to local_settings.py so that .gitignore will not push it to the repo
# make sure to remove the # from the front of the next line after you add your secret key

# secret_key = 'your generated secret key here!'
